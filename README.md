# Auction House #

The Auction House project is a simulation (and graphical representation) of
a network-based interactive triplet of programs consisting of a Bank, one or
more Auction Houses, and one or more Agents or users who bid on items
available for persual from an Auction House. Agents and Auction Houses open
accounts with the Bank, which serves as a conduit for monetary transactions
between an Agent and an Auction House.

## Getting Started ##

The project can be run directly from the latest trio .jar file(s), with
filenames Bank.jar, AuctionHouse.jar, and Agent.jar,
which can be downloaded and opened directly on a single computer on multiple
computers (for example, with Bank, AuctionHouse, and Agent all running
all separate computers simultaneously, but on the same network).
The project could also be run from inside IntelliJ IDEA, with the main
access point being the Main class in the Bank and AuctionHouse packages and
the Agent class in the Agent package.

Because of the connectivity dependence among the three components, it works
best to start the Bank first, then the other two components in either order.

## Running the Program: Participating in an Auction ##

Generally, the most straightforward startup process involves the following
sequence of steps (see more detailed explanation further below):

(1) Start the Bank;
(2) Start one or more Auction Houses;
(3) Start one or more Agents.

<u>Starting the Bank</u>. the user is presented with a GUI …

<u>Starting an Auction House</u>. the user is presented with a GUI …

<u>Starting an Agent</u>. the user is presented with a GUI …

The GUIs for the Bank and an Auction House allow monitoring of activity, but
little else …

<u>Agent Participating in an Auction</u>.

## Built With ##

The program was written in Java and JavaFX, using IntelliJ IDEA.

## Some Development Notes ##

<b>Thurs, Fri, Sat 11/15 -- 11/17</b>
1st intensive meetings of our trio, reviewing project specifications and
considering plausible designs for the main components of Bank, Agent, and
Auction House. Activities included review and implementation of the
Knock!Knock! code provided by lab instructor Brooke Chenoweth, discussion
of possible Message class structure, and discussion of various aspects of the
design suggested by the class instructor Prof. Roman.

## Design & Design Issues ##

The general design is shown in the instance diagram included in the /doc
directory.

## Further Development ##

The program functions and conforms reasonable well to the general
design specifications. Some immediate next steps in development would
