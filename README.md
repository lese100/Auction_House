## Some Development Notes ##

<b>Thurs, Fri, Sat 11/15 -- 11/17</b>
1st intensive meetings of our trio, reviewing project specifications and
considering plausible designs for the main components of Bank, Agent, and
Auction House. Activities included review and implementation of the
Knock!Knock! code provided by lab instructor Brooke Chenoweth, discussion
of possible Message class structure, and discussion of various aspects of the
design suggested by the class instructor Prof. Roman.
